# robotGladiators

## Objective:
Let the hackathon commence! In this module, you’ll explore the power of JavaScript as you build a super sleek computer game called Robot Gladiators to be entered in a hackathon competition with specific requirements. After you build an MVP (minimum viable product) of the game, you’ll improve it by increasing its complexity.

### Game States
// "WIN" - Player robot has defeated all enemy-robots
//    * Fight all enemy-robots
//    * Defeat each enemy-robot
// "LOSE" - Player robot's health is zero or less
