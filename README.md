# robotGladiators

## Objective:
Let the hackathon commence! In this module, you’ll explore the power of JavaScript as you build a super sleek computer game called Robot Gladiators to be entered in a hackathon competition with specific requirements. After you build an MVP (minimum viable product) of the game, you’ll improve it by increasing its complexity.
